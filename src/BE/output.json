            "Sorauerstraße is a silent street between Wrangelkiez and Görlitzer Park near to the Canal.. Lovely Cafe-Sora is downstairs! U-Bahnhof Schlesisches Tor is 2 Minutes by walk.. REWE, Lidl, Eurogida and Bio-Company are the closest Shops! Everything you need is just around the corner..",

            "Just for the record, you can stay in the flat as long as you want from our side if we get along well but the only thing is that Anmeldung is not possible because i have my Anmeldung somewhere else due to my Kids Kindergarten and Hausverwaltung unfortunately doesn’t give this Wohnungsgeberbestätigung to the Subtenants.. An Apartment-viewing is possible at any time.. And for last, please write a short description about yourself with at least one photo attached, otherwise you will get no answer! And yes, as long as the ad is online, it is still available.."
