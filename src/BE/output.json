            "A room in my flat is becoming available from August onwards 750 euros month (although the landlady will likely increase the rent) The room is fully furnished and has two big windows overlooking the Hinterhof (so it's quite bright. The room gets mostly afternoon sun. The room comes with: a bed, a wardrobe and a desk (I have to double check with my housemate to see what ekse came with the room).",
            "The flat is located in Friedenau close to the U9 (2-3 minutes by foot) and to the Ringbahn (8-10 minutes by foot). The s1 is also not too far away (15-20 minutes by foot). There are multiple shops nearby (Nahkauf, Netto, Rewe, Edeka, bakeries, you name it). It is also not too far away from the shopping streets in Steglitz.",
            "Pls this is not a Zweck-WG, the ideal wg life for me is one in which we can hangout, cook together, go out together but at the same time have our own lives and can respect each other's time. Also, considering that most of the neighbors are families or older people this is not a party flat. A bit about me: -I'm 24 (although I will turn 25 quite soon) -studied art history and I'm currently working full-time -On my free time I enjoy going to museums, reading, watching movies and series (I watch drag race religiously hahaha) and also enjoy going to zumba and jumping fitness classes.",
            "Important info: -Anmeldung is possible -I'm mainly looking for someone FLINTA. -Ideally you are in your mid to late twenties. -No smoker and no pets. -the room cannot be shared by a couple. -You ideally work or are a bit further in your studies (so, no first year students, sorry!)"
